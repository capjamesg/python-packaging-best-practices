This guide is intended as reference material for packaging Python projects and preparing them for release. In this 
guide, we have covered everything from writing a comprehensive README to what to include in your project release 
notes (if your project is a library).

While packaging work can feel secondary to the "main" work of a project, writing strong documentation, developing 
a continuous integration pipeline, and other pieces of advice mentioned in this e-book are a crucial part of 
publishing a project.

The easier your project is to understand and the less time it takes to solve a problem with your project, the 
better. A big part of this is providing an easy way for someone to get started: concise installation instructions, 
a web demo, etc.

If you have any topics you would like to see covered in this e-book, or exapanded upon, please review our 
contribution guidelines for more information. I am eager to include as much information as possible here, while 
preserving conciseness, to build a one-stop-shop for key information about preparing Python projects for release.

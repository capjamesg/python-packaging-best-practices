## Release Notes

Release notes help developers track the evolution of your project. You should write release notes before 
publishing any version of your project, if your project is a library intended for distribution. Keep note of all 
of your release notes in a changelog. The Make a Changelog site has an easy-to-use template you can use to start 
your project changelog.

In your changelog, note:

- Additions: What methods and logic did you add to the project?
- Deprecations: Did you remove anything from the library?
- Bugs Fixed: What bugs did you fix? Include links to any GitHub Issues that may be relevant to the bug.
- And anything else you think is important for someone to know who is reading your changelog.
